## _Classic way of writing JavaScript_
- Make an `index.html` file and add `script.js` file in it
- This is the **_traditional way_**

## _JS Engine_ 
 JavaScript comes with a compiler that can turn your javascript code into browser executable code 
- V8
- Spider Monkey
- Deno
- Node Js

And these engines make the code browser executable. Hence, we don't need to attach a JS file to HTML, we can directly run those javascript codes.
