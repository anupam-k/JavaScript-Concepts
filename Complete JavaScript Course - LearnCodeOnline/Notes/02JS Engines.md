## _Classic way of writing JavaScript_
- Make an **`index.html`** file and add **`script.js`** file in it
- Add the **`script tag`** at the **end of HTML file** to connect **JS** to our **HTML**
- This is the **_traditional way_**

## _JS Engine_ 
- First of all, consider **Javascript** similar to any langauage like **C or C++**
- And We need a **set of tools to convert** this _**Javascript code**_ into _**Machine understandable code**_
- **JavaScript** comes with _a compiler that can turn your javascript code into browser executable code_ 

## _Some JS Engines_
- **V8**
- **Spider Monkey**
- **Deno**
- **Node Js**

## _Notes_
- And these **engines** make the code **_browser executable_**.
- Hence, we **don't need to attach a JS file to HTML**, we can **directly run** those _**Javascript Codes**_
