# _Javascript | Interview Questions_
- First name Of Js  - Mocha

- Launched year of JS - 1995

- JS was designed for frontend or backend 
   - initially was made for frontend later on the backend

- which kind of software do we use to run js - node js

- can I run the js program in the browser and where - yes, console.log

- how can I declare variables: let, var, const

- which introduced ES6: let and const

- Syntax of ES6: let and const

- What is a Variable: variable is like a container that stores values of different datatypes

- const: initialisation should be done on the spot at the time of declaration

- read hoisting in depth(Homework)

- Two broad category of data types: primitives and non-primitives(is also called object)

- diff between primitives and non-primitives:
  primitives: storing one single type of value
  non-primitives: storing multiple type of value

- _Data types under Primitive:_
  - Number
  - String 
  - Boolean
  - Null
  - Undefined

- diff between null and undefined
  [Read Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/undefined-vs-null-in-javascript/#:~:text=Definition%3A,not%20exist%20in%20the%20compiler.)

- Data types under Non - Primitive:
  - Array
  - Object

- Math

const PI = Math.PI
console.log(PI);
//3.14

  - Everything comes from that Math

Number to get rounded
console.log(Math.roun(9.91));
// Error with spelling roun

console.log(Math.round(9.91));
// 10

console.log(Math.floor(9.91));
// 9

console.log(Math.min(9.91,8.5));
// 8.5 (need atleast 2 values two values to compare and more)

### _Imp math functions:_
- Math.round
- Math.floor
- Math.ceil
- Math.max
- Math.random
- Math.pow
- Math.sqrt

- in what range random produces from 0 to 0.99999

- Generate random num between 0 to 10

let randum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
console.log(randum);

### _String_

let user = '' and  ""

let user = 'Anurag ';
let username = "Anurag";

console.log(user[4]);
// a

let user = 'Anurag ';
console.log(user.toUpperCase());
// ANURAG 

### _Imp string functions:_
 -  toUpperCase
 -  toLowerCase
 -  substr
 -  split
 -  includes
 -  replace
 -  charAt
 -  indexOf
 -  concat
 -  startWith
 -  endWith
 -  search
 -  match
 -  repeat
 -  length

length: property

## _Truthy Value and Falsy Value_

### _Anything which results in True is called Truthy Value_  
- All the numbers positive and negative
- All string except empty string

### _Anything which results in False is called Falsy Value_
- undefined, null, 0, empty string, NaN

## _Coercion in JavaScript:  Read About It_

## _Operators_
   - Assignment Operator(=)
   - Arithmetic Operator(+ , - , / , * , % , **)
   - Comparision Operator(==, > < , >= <= !=, ===)
   - Logical Operator(&&, ||)
   - Ternary Operator or Ternary Condition
